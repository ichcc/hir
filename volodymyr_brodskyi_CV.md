## Summary

Infrastructure architect with 20+ years in IT and 10+ specializing in DevOps. I design cloud environments for reliability, automate everything that shouldn't require a human, and lead migrations that others call impossible. From 30PB data operations to fintech platforms built from scratch — I treat infrastructure as a strategic asset, not a cost center.
